        <h2><b>What is Dropout Rate?</b></h2>
        <br>
        <h3>The dropout rate is measured in terms of the percentage of students who leave school before completing their
          level/grade.
          It is a critical indicator of the effectiveness of the education system.
          The UDISE+ 2021-22 data reveals that the overall dropout rate in schools in India is 1.5 percent, which is
          lower than the previous year’s rate of 1.8 percent. However, the rate is still a concern, especially in
          certain states. </h3>

      <div class="how">
        <h2><b>How does it affect the nation?</b></h2>
        <br>
        <h3>
          When children drop out of school, it not only affects their personal growth and development but also has
          far-reaching implications for the country’s overall development.
          The lack of education leads to the creation of a population with inadequate skills, ultimately affecting the
          country’s productivity and competitiveness.
          It also contributes to the growth of social and economic disparities and exacerbates existing inequalities.
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="who">
        <h2><b>Who drops out more?</b></h2>
        <br>
        <h3>
          Dropout rates vary by region, socio-economic status, gender, and level of education in India. However, girls
          generally tend to drop out of school more often than boys.
          Overall, addressing the underlying causes of dropout rates requires a multi-pronged approach, including
          improving the quality of education, increasing access to education,
          addressing socio-economic disparities, and promoting gender equality.

      <h1><b>Why do children dropout of the schools?</b></h1>
      <br><br>
      <h2>1. Poverty Accessibility and Availability:</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Poverty, accessibility and availability are the major reasons of school dropouts in India. For
        example, most of the Government schools in the coastal areas of Kerala are being used as
        reliefcampsduring monsoon season. Some people have been living in these camps (schools)
        for last three years. Government has not made any arrangements to settle these people.
        Therefore there is no place for the students to study
      </h3>
      <br><br>
      <h2>2. Lack of Interest:</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Lack of interest is caused by their lack of
        attention in whatever is being taught. It is not that such students do not try. They do try as and
        when they are forced and pressurized to. It is then that these students prefer going the otherway. They prefer
        dropping out of their school because once and for all they decide that
        whatever is being taught there barely intrigues them.
      </h3>
      <br><br>
      <h2>3. Excessive academic pressure from school and parents:</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Many students leave the schools because of the inability to deal with the academic pressure
        and debilitating anxiety. Many parents have high expectations about their children they never
        consider the abilities and interests of the children.Some of them end up in alcoholism and substance abuse.
      </h3>
      <br><br>
      <h2>4. The family background of the students:</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        There is often a clash between the family values and those of the school. Frequently, their
        parents have dropped out of school themselves. The students come from families from low
        socio-economic backgrounds, where there are many other children. Older children often have
        to go to work in order to supply the family with much-needed funds for basic family needs or
        need to stay home to take care of younger siblings so that their parents can work. Many
        children are products of divorce, separation or, sometimes, family violence.
      </h3>
      <br><br>
      <h2>5. The community they belong:</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Many children live on the wrong side of the tracks in places where education is not valued,
        where drugs, gangs and violence abound. And where schools are low-performing, they often
        lack community and health support.
      </h3>
      <br><br>
      <h2>6. Menstruation amongst young girls:</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        A UNICEF study states that 71 per cent of adolescent girls in India remain unaware of menstruation until they
        get their first period, and when they do so, many drop out of school.

      <h1><b>Prospective Solutions: </b></h1>
      <br><br>
      <h3>The Indian government has undoubtedly made great strides in the area of education, but more needs to be done
        to address school
        dropouts if we want this work to be even more successful. In India, 96 percent of students currently have access
        to an elementary
        education. As it takes a lot of effort to enrol this many children in school, every effort must be made to
        retain them. The respondents
        suggested the following measures to reduce dropout rates in our country:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>&#149;Awareness Programmes by the Government, NGO's, and Individuals: Awareness programmes should be run
            in cities and villages in
            order to spread awareness and knowledge about the ill effects that illiteracy and unemployment can cause.
          </li>
          <li>&#149;The government should launch more programmes to ensure higher enrollment. The quality of midday
            meals should be improved for
            better retention.</li>
          <li>&#149; Better sanitation facilities. The government and agencies responsible for education need to focus
            on
            improving the surroundings of
            the child, as ‘A strong mind cannot survive in a weak body’.</li>
          <li>&#149; Good infrastructure should be established in schools so as to draw students closer to education and
            spark their interest.</li>
          <li>&#149; Facilitating stronger communication between the school and the parents</li>
          <li>&#149; Incorporating more skill-based education: Many students drop out of school because they feel that a
            basic education cannot help
            them secure jobs. To tackle this problem, education should be made more skill-oriented.</li>
          <li>&#149; Creating a tool which will help the students developing skills and get a job in the domain in which
            they are interested, if even after all the above efforts they still choose to drop out. </li>
        </ul>
